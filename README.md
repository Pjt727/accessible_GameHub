# accessible-battleship
Using speech recognition to allow people to play battleship


Context:
- this was a 12-hour hackathon project (unedited besides this README)
- group members are Patrick Tyler, Ryan Munger, and Nick Longo
    - All freshmen at Marist College at the time of making this
- the theme for this hackathon was accessibility
- There is not any history for this project because we were still learning how to fully utilize GitHub and it was difficult to assign people modular tasks

What this app does:
- gives users the ability for users to do most functions with only the voice
    - select game
    - choose game options such as a colorblind mode
    - play a move in the game
 
How this was created:
- We used PyGame to create all of our games from scratch
- Google voice recognition  API is used to get the user's voice


One method of instillation for windows:
- make virtual env
    - python3 -m venv .venv
    - ./.venv/Scripts/activate
- install libraries
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
